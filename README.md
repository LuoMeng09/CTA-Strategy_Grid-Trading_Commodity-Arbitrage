# CTA-Strategy_Grid-Trading_Commodity-Arbitrage
The essence of the grid trading method is regression. When facing a single asset, there is usually a certain level of systemic risk. We shift our focus to a portfolio of assets with a certain degree of correlation, using pair trading to hedge part of the systemic risk. After statistical tests for stationarity and cointegration, we select suitable commodity combinations for grid trading, including the gold-silver ratio, copper-gold ratio, and copper-oil ratio.
